# Rust Turing Machine

## Foreword

I built this project in the fall of sophomore year, shortly after taking a course on computability, complexity, and automata. After the class, I became curious about Turing-completeness and wanted to explore it by implementing a Turing machine in Rust. I found this to be a fun and challenging way to test my computational and theoretical skills.

## Structure

The project is split into two main parts:

- **Library (`lib.rs`)** – Contains the core logic for creating and running a Turing machine.  
- **Example (`main.rs`)** – A deterministic, halting Turing machine that checks whether a string is a palindrome (class P), demonstrating the library in use.
